In this script you can add and check for the numbers if they are even or odd numbers.
For Example when you start the script it prints a menu to select from 1 to 5 one number.
===== MENU =====
1. Add and check numbers
2. See all batches
3. See stats
4. Save to CSV
5. Exit
If you select the number one then the script will ask you to enter numbers seperated by commas.
When you enter some numbers then the script will show you which numbers are even and which are odd numbers.
Afer that the menu will be printed again and if you enter the number 2 then you will see all the batches.
In the number 3 we have the stats, For example the stats will look like this:
===== STATISTICS =====
Total numbers entered: 5
Even numbers: 2
Odd numbers: 3
Highest even number: 4
Lowest even number: 2
Highest odd number: 5
Lowest odd number: 1
=======================
In the number 4 we have the option to save the numbers in csv mode.When we enter the number 4 our script will request from you to enter a name for your csv file in order to create and save the numbers in the csv file.
And the last one is the Exit.
It was a simple script with different options.I will try to add new things in this script to be more usefull.
