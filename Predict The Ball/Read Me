What we did in this script?
We created one of the most known games in the world (Three Cups) with Python.
At the beggining of the script when you run the script you will get this message :
--- 🎲 Welcome to 'Find the Ball' Game! 🎲 ---
and the script will ask you to enter one amount in order to place a bet: 
How much you will bet? 
After you give to the script an int number then it will ask from you to predict in which cup is the ball.
User can select 0 or 1 or 2 to predict the ball.
If user predicts the correct cup then the script will show you this message: 
Correct, you are lucky
You won: 2$

Do you want to play again? (yes/no):
If you select yes then you will play again the game.Otherwise the script will show you this message and the script will stop:
Thanks for playing! 👋
If user don't predict the correct cup then he/she will get this message:
Good luck in next round 
['O', '', '']

Do you want to play again? (yes/no):
After this it is the same from line 14 till 15.
